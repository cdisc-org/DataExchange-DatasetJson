## <a id="introduction"></a>Introduction

The DSJC (Dataset-JSON Compressed) format is a standardized method for compressing Dataset-JSON content. It specifically uses the Dataset-NDJSON format as the base structure and applies zLib compression to create a more compact representation of the data. This specification describes the DSJC format in a language-neutral manner to ensure interoperability across different platforms and programming environments.

## <a id="formatdefinition"></a>Format Definition

DSJC is defined as a direct zLib compression stream of Dataset-NDJSON format content without additional headers, signatures, or metadata beyond what the zLib format itself provides.

## <a id="baseformat"></a>Base Format: Dataset-NDJSON

The Dataset-NDJSON format serves as the base format for DSJC as it provides better streaming capabilities. It consists of:

1. **First Line**: A JSON object containing Dataset-JSON metadata (without the rows property)
2. **Subsequent Lines**: Each line is a valid JSON array or object representing a single data record

Usage of whitespace characters should be reduced to a minimum required by the Dataset-NDJSON format. Avoid spaces between JSON array elements or attribute definitions.

Example of Dataset-NDJSON before compression:

```json
{"datasetJSONCreationDateTime":"2023-01-01T12:00:00","datasetJSONVersion":"1.1","records":3,"name":"ADSL","label":"Subject Level Analysis Dataset","columns":[...]}
["SUBJ001",45,"M"]
["SUBJ002",52,"F"]
["SUBJ003",38,"M"]
```

## <a id="compression"></a>Compression

DSJC applies standard zLib compression to the entire Dataset-NDJSON content:

1. **Compression Algorithm**: zLib (DEFLATE)
2. **Compression Level**: Implementers may choose an appropriate compression level, with 9 (maximum compression) recommended for storage-optimized scenarios and lower levels for performance-sensitive applications
3. **Window Size**: 15 bits (32 KB window) is recommended
4. **Strategy**: Default compression strategy is recommended

## <a id="fileformat"></a>File Format

A DSJC file consists solely of the zLib-compressed byte stream without any additional headers, signatures, or metadata wrapping. The zLib format itself contains sufficient information for decompressors to reconstruct the original Dataset-NDJSON content.

## <a id="fileextensionandmimetype"></a>File Extension and MIME Type

Files following this specification should use the .dsjc file extension. The recommended MIME type is:

```text
application/vnd.cdisc.dataset-json.compressed
```

## <a id="processingoverview"></a>Processing Overview

### <a id="creatingdsjc"></a>Creating a DSJC File

The process to create a DSJC file consists of:

1. Construct a Dataset-NDJSON format representation of the data:
   - First line contains dataset metadata as a JSON object
   - Each subsequent line contains a single record as a JSON array or object
2. Apply zLib compression to the entire Dataset-NDJSON content
3. Write the compressed byte stream to a file

### <a id="readingdsjc"></a>Reading a DSJC File

The process to read a DSJC file consists of:

1. Open the file and apply zLib decompression to the content
2. Process the decompressed content as Dataset-NDJSON:
   - First line: Parse as JSON object to extract metadata
   - Subsequent lines: Parse each line as a JSON array or object representing a data record

## <a id="implementation"></a>Implementation Considerations

### <a id="memoryefficiency"></a>Memory Efficiency

When processing large datasets, implementers should consider streaming approaches for both compression and decompression to avoid loading the entire dataset into memory.

### <a id="compressionlevelselection"></a>Compression Level Selection

Implementers may choose different compression levels based on their specific use case. As main purpose of the Dataset-JSON format is data exchange, the maximum compression level (9) is recommended by default.

- Level 1-3: Faster compression, lower compression ratio
- Level 4-6: Balanced compression speed and ratio
- Level 7-9: Higher compression ratio, slower compression

### <a id="errorhandling"></a>Error Handling

Implementations should gracefully handle the following error cases:

- Invalid or corrupt zLib compressed data
- Malformed JSON in the decompressed content
- Inconsistency between metadata and actual data records

### <a id="compatibility"></a>Compatibility

To ensure maximum compatibility, implementations should:

- Use standard zLib libraries available on most platforms
- Follow the Dataset-NDJSON format strictly, with proper line delimiters
- Ensure proper handling of character encodings (UTF-8 recommended)

## <a id="benefits"></a>Benefits

The DSJC format offers several benefits:

1. Reduced Size: Significant reduction in file size compared to uncompressed Dataset-JSON
2. Simplified Implementation: Leverages widely available zLib libraries, available in SAS, R, Python, and other languages
3. Streaming Support: Enables record-by-record processing without decompressing or loading the entire dataset
4. Platform Independence: Works consistently across different operating systems and programming languages

## <a id="limitations"></a>Limitations

Implementers should be aware of the following limitations:

1. Processing Overhead: Compression and decompression require additional CPU resources
2. Random Access: DSJC doesn't provide direct random access to specific records without decompressing the preceding content

## <a id="conformance"></a>Conformance

A conforming implementation must:

1. Correctly compress Dataset-NDJSON content using the zLib compression algorithm
2. Successfully decompress DSJC files and interpret the content as Dataset-NDJSON
3. Handle errors gracefully as specified in section [Error Handling](#errorhandling).
4. Preserve all semantic information from the original Dataset-JSON content
