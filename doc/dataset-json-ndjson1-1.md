# Representing Dataset-JSON as NDJSON

## Introduction

The purpose of the NDJSON (new-line delimited JSON) representation of Dataset-JSON is to simplify streaming large datasets. With NDJSON, datasets can easily be read or written 1 row at a time without loading the entire dataset into memory. Most programming languages have libraries that can read a large JSON dataset as a stream, but in cases where such a library is not available or performs poorly, the NDJSON format makes it easy for the program to read and write a row at a time. The NDJSON format is an alternative to the JSON format, and both are part of the Dataset-JSON standard.

NDJSON and JSON datasets have the same content. The only difference is that the NDJSON content is written or read as 1 line of valid JSON at a time.

In a data-exchange scenario, the sender and receiver determine whether to use the JSON or NDJSON representation of Dataset-JSON. Given the relative simplicity of the Dataset-JSON specification, converting between the 2 formats is straightforward. NDJSON example datasets were generated by converting existing JSON Dataset-JSON example datasets.

NDJSON Dataset-JSON datasets have a file extension of .ndjson (e.g., ae.ndjson). The JSON format uses the .json extension. This is one way to determine the format used for a dataset file.

## The Dataset-JSON NDJSON format

[NDJSON](https://github.com/NDJSON/NDJSON-spec) is a standard for delimiting JSON in stream protocols. In NDJSON, each
line is valid JSON. The JSON is delimited by the newline character (\n or 0x0A) which may be preceeded by a carriage return character (\r or 0x0D). UTF-8 encoding is expected.

The Dataset-JSON NDJSON format is created from the Dataset-JSON standard by:

* Row 1. Create 1 JSON object that contains the metadata, including the dataset attributes and column definitions.
* Row 2-n. Create 1 JSON array per data row

Each row can be parsed and processed as standalone JSON text.

## Examples

The NDJSON example datasets have been converted from the JSON versions, so they contain the same content. The examples are available in the [DataExchange-DatasetJson repository examples folder](https://github.com/cdisc-org/DataExchange-DatasetJson/tree/master/examples) and use .NDJSON as the extension.
