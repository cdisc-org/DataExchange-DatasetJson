The examples conform to the Dataset-JSON 1.1 specification.

- The examples in the sdtm folder were created from XPT files that were published as part of the [Study Data Tabulation Model Metadata Submission Guidelines (SDTM-MSG): Human Clinical Trials Version 2.0 (Final, 30 March 2021)](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtm/sdtm-metadata-submission-guidelines-v2-0).
- The examples in the adam folder were created from XPT files that were published as part of the [Analysis Data Model Metadata Submission Guidelines (ADaM MSG): Human Clinical Trials Version 1.0 (Final, 18 April 2023)](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/adam/adam-metadata-submission-guidelines-v1-0).
- The examples in the send folder were created from XPT files that were part of the CBER Pilot.

The i18n folder contains a JSON file with the AETERM variable in Japanese.

For illustration purposes several variables in the ADLBC and ADLBH datasets in the ADaM example that had a DataType='float' in Define-XML had their data type converted to 'decimal' in the JSON examples.

The example JSON files, XPT files, and Define-XML documents are for illustration purposes only and may not conform to regulatory health authorities' requirements/guidance.
